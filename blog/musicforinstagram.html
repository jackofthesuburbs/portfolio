                      <p>On further reflection of the ideas in ‘Digital Tarkovsky’, I have been thinking about how to creatively apply/address ideas around time and internet platforms.
                      </p><p>

                      Instagram is regularly discussed as the Social Networking platform that is the most detrimental to our mental health (check <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/2/20983760/instagram-removing-likes-authenticity">here</a>, <a href="https://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39955295">here</a>, and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/instagram-is-the-worst-social-media-for-our-mental-health-what-can-you-do/photostory/69651168.cms">here</a>.)
                      </p><p>

                      I want to experiment creating a music that is more suited to the platforms that competing for our attention, perhaps as a relief to the type of content that contributes to the negative aspects of the platform. </p><p>

                      For this to work I would need to analyse the mechanics of the platform, and adapt the music I make to suit the medium and the ways in which people engage with content on there. </p><p>

                      This type of music might need to be shorter in duration, to accommodate the increasingly shorter attention spans of users when on their smartphones.  </p><p>

                      I’ll be producing my own Instagram works under the project name ‘flow’, a theme that is prevalent in ‘Digital Tarkovsky’. “We experience time as something that flows.”
                      </p><p>

                      By embracing loop-based works they edge into the world of the non-linear, they could either last forever, or less than one full cycle; the duration of the piece is decided by the person listening as they scroll through their Instagram feed.</p><p>

                      These works will have their own ‘flow’ that exist alongside our own.</p>
