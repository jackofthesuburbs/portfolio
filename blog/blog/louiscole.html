                  <p>Louis Cole has been on my radar for long while; this is the first piece of his I saw:

                  I really enjoy the playful nature of the process of his music making, and the playful aesthetics of the videos and music he produces.

                  </p><p>
                  Although he insists that he <a href="https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/louis-cole-delightful-deviance-interview">avoids making his music accessible</a>, I feel that with the fast-paced tempo of the songs, easy to remember hooks, normcore lyrics (talking about everyday stuff, in everyday language), and platform accessibility of his outputs, his music overall is more accessible compared to traditional music releases in the context of the attention economy creators are competing in.

                  </p><p>
                  In the spirit of ‘do first, think later’, my motto for my creative works at the moment, I’m setting myself a challenge to channel my inner Louis Cole and create quick music in my home setting with a similarly basic setup.

                  </p><p>
                  I also really enjoy some of his more technically orchestrated pieces, again released via YouTube, making this accessible to view. The use of a residential space here is really interesting to me. Taking this type of music outside of established music venues adds to the feel of accessibility and authenticity.
                  </p>
