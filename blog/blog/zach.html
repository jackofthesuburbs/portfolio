                      <p>
                      I have been following Zach Lieberman on Instagram for a couple of years. He is an "artist, researcher, hacker dedicated to exploring new modes of expression and play", and "one of the co-founders of openframeworks, a c++ library for creative coding".  I really admire his constant feed of coding sketches and how they iterate around a theme for a couple of weeks, then change drastically to a new idea just like that.
                      </p><p>
                      He has talked about his process of daily sketches a couple of times through <a href="https://medium.com/@zachlieberman/daily-sketches-2016-28586d8f008e">articles on Medium</a>.
                      </p><p>
                      He talks about making this quick and convenient for him to do, and then shares without thinking too much about the final output. Things are never complete, and he’s always ‘iterating’.
                      </p><p>
                      I would like to incorporate this kind of mindset for my own works, having sketches I can play with and share really quickly, but am not quite sure how to do this with music just yet. With visual works I can see that this process makes sense and understand the appeal to his audience.</p>
