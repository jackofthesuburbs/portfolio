So my first ‘tour in a day’ was a real success.

</p><p>
Before and after the performances at each venue, people approached me to find out more about the project. Most people I spoke to ended up finishing off my sentence when explaining the rationale behind the performance, i.e. “rather than relying on people to come out to a venue to watch me perform, I’ll go to where people already are.”

</p><p>

This was a real proof of concept for the project and with a lot of encouraging words from audiences in different venues I have decided to try this out again to see if all the success wasn’t just a fluke of the day.

</p><p>
I learnt that decisions around the duration of the piece had left people wanting more, which is something I would rather do than proceed to play too long for even one person in the space/venue. At the point of finishing the performance, I could then hand over a zine with further information about the project and how to find out where I would be playing next.

</p><p>
What I enjoyed most about this process was that became a stimulus for conversation with strangers. I had some really great conversations with people about music and their listening habits. I even got offers to play at the barber shop on a regular basis and to play at Le Pub regularly once they have finished their renovations upstairs.

</p><p>
So all in all, a very successful experiment, one which I will be repeating and developing further.

</p><p>
Here’s a quick compilation video showing some of the places I played at, using footage that I live-streamed on Instagram throughout the day.</p>
