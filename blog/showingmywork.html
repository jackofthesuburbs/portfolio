  Here are a few things I've reflected on and taken on board from the series of books from Austin Kleon:
</p><p>
  I need to talk more about the things I love, off and online.
</p><p>
  "People want to see how the sausage is made."<br>
  I normally hide my work while I'm working on something and am cautious about sharing anything until it's completely finished. This is partly down to being exposed when something isn't 'perfect', and partly down to the fear of someone stealing my idea and doing it themeselves. I've decided neither of these thoughts are particularly rational: people (including myself) do like seeing things before they are finished, they know it isn't finished because you've said so. And if anything I do is worth stealing and is done by someone else, I would take definitely take that as a compliment. The idea that an idea I have had is worth stealing is quite nice. Ideally things I do would be used as inpiration for other work rather than being stolen out right, but I guess this is out of my hands.
</p><p>
  <b>Send out a daily dispatch</b><br>
  By focusing on sending SMOMETHING out daily, I will be sending out way more stuff over a month than I would if I was precious about my posts.
</p><p>
  <b>Think process not product</b><br>
  Focus on sharing my processes as much as my products. These might be just as interesting, if not more, and make the products way more appealing.
</p><p>
  <b>Be interest-ing</b><br>
  Use interest as a verb, take an interest in things that are happening around me, and share this. This makes my own work more interesting.
</p><p>
  <b>Looking for time</b><br>
  Having read a few articles about the 100 hour work week, I am already reflecting on how I spend my time. I do this every so often anyway, but need to do this again soon to accommodate changes in my schedule in recent months. I can definitely work more smartly than I already am.
</p><p>
  <b>Talk about yourself at parties</b><br>
  I always struggle with how I describe myself. I don't enjoy having my job title label me as a whole. I never have. But I do see functionality in doing something like this when meeting new people (Mark hate the term network, so do I). I've decided to embrace Austin's advice and focus on verbs when describing myself and practice - "do the verb" - and use the phrase 'I'm an artist that makes music' as a holding tagline for me and my work. It'll do for now for sure.
</p><p>
  <b>It's okay to 'sell out'</b><br>
  Even the Renaissance had to be funded.
</p><p>
  <b>The creative life is not linear, you never arrive</b><br>
  It's okay to feel like you're starting again. The creative life is more like a loop in which you keep coming back to a new starting point after every project.
</p><p>
  <b>Be boring</b><br>
  Getting stuff done requires being 'broing' most of the time. Get a routine and stick to it. If you keep doing what you keep doing, you keep getting what you keep getting.
</p><p>
  <b>Steal like an artist</b><br>
  Keep a swipe file of things I like that other people are doing. I can use these things to influence my own work.
</p><p>
  <b>Write the book you want to read</b><br>
  If my favourite musician were to release a new album, what would this sounds like? Make it. It will never truly sound like them as too much of ME will rub off in the process. Write the music I want to hear.
