                      ‘tour in a day’ @ Art on the Hill
                      At the end of last week I did some performances for a second iteration of my 'tour in a day' project as part of Art on the Hill in Newport. This time round I had the help of a trusty tour guide, taking me from venue to venue, and a handy photographer, documenting and streaming the performances.

                      </p><p>
                      The audience size varied from venue to venue, but the response was extremely positive in each space.  I was asked a number of questions about the idea, and the responses were well received. Like the tour, I got the impression people were left wanting more, and I was asked if I had a card a number of times. I haven't got one for 'personal projects', and wasn't sure what the purpose of one would be.

                      </p><p>
                      I've since reflected on this idea and have decided to create a zine that serves the purpose of a business card, i.e. have contact details on them, but also to include visual artworks, thunk type games and possibly codes to scan to take people directly to online works.

                      </p><p>
                      Here is the footage from the Art on the Hill 'Tour in a Day', including an edited version of the track: </p>
