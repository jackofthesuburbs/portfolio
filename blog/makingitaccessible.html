                    <p>
                    After revisiting some of the posts as part of my research, I am definitelty seeing a thread here around accessibility, both in terms of interactvity of works, but also the presentation of my practice as a whole.</p><p>

                    I've decided that the public facing project won't directly include discussions about time, or anything else that I would consider academic research and discourse. This stuff I am going to keep here.</p><p>

                    The jack of the suburbs website will be a playful experience to navigate, celebratory and encouraging in its rhetoric about collaborative music-making.
                    </p><p>

                    Content on the website will encourage what I believe to be a "good" use time spent on our smartphones and digital devices, and opportunities to play in 'real life', encouraging meaningful social interactions. Again, this won't be done directly through the language on the site, but through the things you can see/hear there.
                    </p><p>

                    This ethos will also apply to how I discuss music-making tools. Rather than refering to these as instruments, I aim to develop and promote a more accessible langauge that is inclusive to those who don't identify as being able to play an instrument.
                    </p>
