                  <tr>
                    <td class="sizer">

                    <p>Brad Troemel is an artist and writer, once dubbed <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/brad-troemel-the-troll-of-internet-art">the troll of internet art</a>. His position has often been outré, at the edges of major galleries and glossy monthlies. He first gained a following as a founder of the Jogging, a well known Tumblr site, and later shifted his very online output to platforms like Etsy and <a href="https://www.uvproductionhouse.com/shop/nothing-says-not-my-president-like-bolt-adapter-58-in-11unc-x-m10-125-mm">Squarespace</a> to sell kits for on-demand artworks (things like tacos fastened shut with padlocks).</p><p>

                    His current focus on the square JPEG on Instagram picks up on what he advocated in earlier essays, such as 2013’s “<a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/athletic-aesthetics/">Athletic Aesthetics</a>”.</p><p>

                    His shitposting about art critics and white galleries is part of a sincere attempt to forge a new sort of relationship to art and its infrastructure, beyond a stratifying gallery system that makes a direct connection to an audience on social media.</p><p>

                    Troemel’s memes continually ask broad questions like: Why make art? Why make objects? How is art valued, who values it, and why? But his rawest criticisms are reserved for the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxSZ7-DliOj/">economics of art</a>. His posts skewer the people and institutions who pretend that artist, critic, and curator are somehow viable upwardly mobile professions. (As <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BrqFh8vlh7h/">he rightly observes</a>, you can’t pay rent with “exposure.”)</p><p>

                    Troemel is honest about where his revenue comes from: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/31041471">Patreon</a>, a crowdfunding platform for creatives to receive small monthly donations from individual “patrons,” often in return for exclusive content.</p><p>

                    Troemel has embraced a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxh35TXlGaz/">system of compensation</a> and feedback to match his digitally mass-distributed forms of art. In exchange for a few dollars a month, he offers short video lectures and half-hour studio visits via Skype. This approach seems to have effectively narrowed the gap between the artist and his public.</p><p>

                    I started following this account right at the time I was thinking about how to talk about my project and present it publicly. Posts like this were a great reminder to consider my audience when presenting my project, and keep descriptions simple and accessible.</p>
