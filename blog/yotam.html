                      <p>
                      I came across <a href="https://yotammann.info/">Yotam Mann</a> through another influence of mine, <a href="https://sarahrothberg.com/">Sarah Rothberg</a>, as they have collaborated on a few projects together.</p><p>
                      </p><p>
                      Yotam Mann is a musician and instrument builder, who makes music with code. He has developed a JavaScript library for making interactive music in the web browser called <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">tone.js</a>.
                      </p><p>

                      A particular work that I like, (that I had myself thought about making before I came across it) is <a href="http://jazz.computer/">Jazz.Computer</a>. It’s an interactive music piece that develops as the user scrolls the mouse of their computer.
                      </p><p>

                      I like that the interaction required to make music is something we are so used to doing anyway, a familiar mechanic.

                      </p><p>
                      The song speeds up the faster you scroll and visuals respond in their own way. The sonic aesthetic lends itself for this type of control by a‘non’performer’, it is non-linear and weaves in and out of being synchronous.

                      </p><p>
                      I’d like to maybe make a number of these in replace of an EP for the next batch of music I write.

                      </p><p>
                      I will also be looking into tone.js to see if I can make anything with it as I being my coding adventure.</p>
