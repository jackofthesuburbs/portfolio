                      Okay, maybe this is more than just about time, or time was just a an entry point for something more broader, but more malleable and marketable.
                      </p><p>
                      My fascination with new perceptions of time sat along my thoughts around space and identity also, and my focus on time over the past few months was down to my thinking that exploring the three ideas would easily sprawl and not be focused enough for an MA project.
                      </p><p>
                      However on very recent reflection, I think the time aspect of what I am actually exploring is unavoidably interconnected with space, and actually is just a part of my very early thoughts around what it means to be a musician in the post-internet age.
                      </p><p>
                      This, along with the idea of musicking (which for me with my educator hat on is about making music making accessible, and blurring the lines between the acts of creation and consumption), means exploring post-internet modes of making and listening to music. And by doing so, bridging the gap between the two, to encourage more active listening experiences; taking advantage of how our perceptions of time and space have mutated over the last decade, and the tools that caused this, and trying to highlight and potentially combat some of the negative symptoms surrounding this as they unfold.
                      </p><p>
                      This way, I get to develop jack of the suburbs as a multi-faceted project and still get to explore other areas of interest, such as space and identity, without having to worry about making sure everything I make is routed in the theme of time.
                      </p><p>
                      I think in the long run this would allow me to develop more marketable and fundable programmes of work.
                      </p><p>
                      So... what I've done here is zoomed out a little bit, but found a clearer thread that can run through all of the things I do: post-internet musicking. The term post-internet is loaded with ideas about what it means to be a person following the widespread adoption of the internet, including its effect on perceptions of time.
