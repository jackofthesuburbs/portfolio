<p>
Why?</p><p>
In recent years I have noticed a pattern in the rhetoric of how the use of digital, smartphones and tablets in particular, has impacted human behaviour in a variety of fields. It is often cautionary, without quite knowing exactly what the problem is. But whatever it is, there seems to be one. And it is often deemed inevitable, an unavoidable issue without knowing who to blame or what the solution is. </p>
<p>
As digital communication technologies have reached ubiquity, their impact is reflected in a legacy of new human habits and behaviours that are now part of a cause and effect cycle fuelling platform capitalism. I aim to explore how mobile digital technologies and internet platforms have accelerated our pace of life in the name of convenience of consumption, in relation to the visually biased nature of the interactions they allow.
</p><p>
Initial research suggests that although we’re supposed to have more free time because of the convenience internet platforms provides us, for many of us we are using it to do more of the same: instantaneous passive consumption of content, products and information. We seem to have more free time than ever before but we’re also busier than ever before.
</p><p>
What?
</p><p>
I want to create music that reflects this phenomena. I want to explore creating passive music to see if this type of media can exist alongside visually biased internet content platforms, but also create active/interactive music experiences.
</p><p>
I aim to evidence that interactivity and participation gives listeners a deep engagement with music. I want to push music beyond the confines of the standard models of consumption; I want new music and new ways of listening.
</p><p>
Therefore, I intend to develop a series of interactive sound works modelling the complex simultaneity of platform temporality, showing how the flow of time has become augmented by the pervasive use of internet platforms. I also want explore developing a new terms for this.
</p><p>
Benjamin Bratton declared that the language of hybrids is part of the problem, when responding to what once was novelty, but is now a new normal. When something new appears, we understand it as a combination of familiar things. Hybrids may make sense by way of analogy but they can quickly create confusion as the new evolves and resembles the familiar less and less.
</p><p>
How?
</p><p>
In order to do this I intend to develop my knowledge and understanding of programming environments that will help me release these interactive works.
</p><p>
The focus on sound in this project is key to achieving my aim of highlighting an issue around pace 0f life and our perceptions of time. It would be impossible to consume sonic content at the rate in which we can now consume visual content, which is augmented by online platforms, without more obviously disrupting the experience. Creating a music work allows me to model a temporal issue through a temporal medium, giving a clearer insight to the changes that are occurring.
