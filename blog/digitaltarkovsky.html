              <p>"Digital Tarkovsky", published by <a href="http://metahaven.net/">metahaven</a>, is "an extended poetic exploration of how our experiences of visual entertainment and time itself are changing in the era of the smartphone and near-constant connection."
              </p><p>
              It investigates the type of experiences we have with our smartphones, viewing them as cinematic experiences, and how they have impacted our perceptions of time.
              </p><p>
              I have been fascinated by the perceived increase in our pace of life, which is perpetuated by the develpment of technologies that make our life more 'convenient'. By decreasing the temporal demand of each activity we are able to fit in more things in a day, week, month etc. </p><p>
              What I liked about this text was that it discusses these ideas in the specific context of digital platforms and smartphones. It highlighted to me the extent that the temporal and spatial dimensions of everyday life are complexly interconneted with digital screens. And that there are alternate timelines in digital space that have fragmented our perception of time, as we become less 'tethered' to our physical shared reality, and more 'tethered' to our digital shared reality, moving ever closer to the full immersion of both worlds.
              </p><p>
              These ideas have influenced a core idea in my current projects; how internet platforms have affected our perceptions of time.
              </p><p>
              I am well aware that all technological developments that have reached ubiquity within a society have had an impact on pace of life and relationship with time. However, I am concerned and interested with the impact of the internet as it transcends realtime in a way that not many other technologies have.
              </p><p>
              These ideas surrounding time will be key to the development of projects and works. I hope to highlight these ideas to a wider audience, or at least provide what I believe to be positive experiences that use the affordances and ubiquity of internet platforms.</p>
