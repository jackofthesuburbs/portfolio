      <b>gary-martin </b> is an artist, designer and educator.

      his socially driven practice explores the way we create and consume things, and broadens access to creative expression.

      his work playfully engages with the relational potentialities of objects and environments through participatory art, toolkit design, and audio-visual composition.

      for over a decade he has facilitated arts workshops with young people across Wales and organisations like Cadw, Prince’s Trust, Shakespeare’s Globe, and Tate Britain.

      he is a creative producer with <a href="https://www.pyka.wales" target="_blank">pyka</a>, co-creating objects, structures and spaces that enable exploration of worlds built with sound.

      he is also a lecturer in the school of creative arts at the <a href="https://instagram.com/uogmusic" target="_blank">University of Gloucestershire </a> where his teaching focuses on networked cultures and the political ecology of creative practice.

      gary-martin currently lives in Abergavenny, and is working to propagate ‘ecology without nature’.<br><br>
