    	<h3>Dynamic Compression</h3> 
        <p> 



The function of compression is to reduce the dynamic range of a piece of audio, i.e. the span between the softest and loudest sounds. The main purpose of this is to subtly massage a piece of audio to make it sound â€˜more naturalâ€™, and more â€˜comfortableâ€™ to listen to. </p>

<p>Also, by reducing the dynamic range, the overall level can be increased - an effect which can be utilised to make tracks louder. Compression has evolved the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=3Gmex_4hreQ&feature=emb_title">Loudness Wars</a>, as tracks compete to stand out on radio shows and playlists. </p>

<p>The basic effect of a compressor is to reduce the volume of a signal once it passes a certain level, called the <b>threshold</b>. Once the audio signal goes beyond the set threshold level, it will be compressed. </p>

<p>The amount of attenuation applied to the signal is known as the <b>compression ratio</b>, which are expressed in decibels - so a ratio of 2:1 indicates that a signal exceeding the threshold by 2dB will be attenuated down to 1dB above threshold. </p>

<img src="/sonicprocessing/compressor.svg" alt="compressor diagram">
	
	    
<p>The higher the ratio, the stronger the compression, with ratios like 8:1 and 10:1 - anything beyond 20:1 is considered limiting, and is used to ensure that a signal doesnâ€™t exceed the amplitude of the threshold. </p>

<p>The <b>knee</b> refers to how the compressor transitions between the non-compressed and compressed states of the signal. A smoother, more gradual compression is known as a â€™soft kneeâ€™, compared to a more distinct â€˜hard kneeâ€™ shape.</p> 

<p>Envelope parameters, <b>attack</b> and <b>release</b>, are used to control the time it takes for the compression to react once the threshold has been passed.</p>

<p>Most compressors have the option to choose between a <b>Peak</b> or <b>RMS</b> setting. Peak is used for fast transient control, RMS (root mean square) means that the compressor will react according to the â€˜average loudnessâ€™ of the input signal.</p>


<h4>Experiment</h4> 

<p>You can download full multitrack audio projects from <a href="https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/">here</a> to experiment with these techniques. I suggest by testing the extremes to hear the differences clearly, then move to create more subtle processing tweaks.</p>
