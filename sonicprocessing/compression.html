<p>Also, by reducing the dynamic range, the overall level can be increased - an effect which can be utilised to make tracks louder. Compression has evolved the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=3Gmex_4hreQ&feature=emb_title">Loudness Wars</a>, as tracks compete to stand out on radio shows and playlists. </p>

​

<p>The basic effect of a compressor is to reduce the volume of a signal once it passes a certain level, called the <b>threshold</b>. Once the audio signal goes beyond the set threshold level, it will be compressed. </p>

​

<p>The amount of attenuation applied to the signal is known as the <b>compression ratio</b>, which are expressed in decibels - so a ratio of 2:1 indicates that a signal exceeding the threshold by 2dB will be attenuated down to 1dB above threshold. </p>

​

<p>The higher the ratio, the stronger the compression, with ratios like 8:1 and 10:1 - anything beyond 20:1 is considered limiting, and is used to ensure that a signal doesn’t exceed the amplitude of the threshold.</p>

​

<p>The <b>knee</b> refers to how the compressor transitions between the non-compressed and compressed states of the signal. A smoother, more gradual compression is known as a ’soft knee’, compared to a more distinct ‘hard knee’ shape.</p> 

​

<p>Envelope parameters, <b>attack</b> and <b>release</b>, are used to control the time it takes for the compression to react once the threshold has been passed.</p>

​

<p>Most compressors have the option to choose between a <b>Peak</b> or <b>RMS</b> setting. Peak is used for fast transient control, RMS (root mean square) means that the compressor will react according to the ‘average loudness’ of the input signal.</p>

<h4>Experiment</h4> 

<p>

You can download full multitrack audio projects from <a href="https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/">here</a> to experiment with these techniques. I suggest by testing the extremes to hear the differences clearly, then move to create more subtle processing tweaks.</p>
