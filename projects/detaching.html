        Detaching is a playful exploration of imagined futures for the music industries, in collaboration with Popular Music students at the University of Gloucestershire. Detaching resulted in a co-created sample pack and a series of practice-based projects accompanied by short manifestos that present ideas for post-sustainability music cultures.

      <div class="grid">
      Selected manifestos have been curated as a zine, published by <a href =“https://www.pittvillepress.co.uk “><i>Pitville Press</i></a>. </div>

       The sample pack was inspired by the blog post <a href="https://klangmag.co/sample-packing-as-social-practice/"><i>'Sample Packing as Social Practice'</i></a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/la_meme_young/?hl=en">Max Alper</a>, and features a variety of textures, pop, and klangs from environmental recordings captured by the students.
