      A Robin, A Garden, A Bulldozer is a mini tropical prog adventure by <a href="https://geocities.ws/jackrees/">Jack Rees</a>, a musican/AV person from Wales. <br><br>This 3 track project is inspired by the daydreams triggered by the sights and sounds from his living room video. <br><br>A Robin is song that came to life watching a robin (called Steve) at his birdfeeder, A Garden is a daydream on the things that rewild the garden at night, and A Bulldozer is a daydream about Steve staring on in horror as a JCB crashes through the garden wall, destroying the garden and demolishing the house. <br><br>It was a hell of a year.
